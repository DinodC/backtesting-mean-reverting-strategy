# Backtesting A Trading Strategy

## Abstract
Backtesting is a tool to measure the performance of a trading strategy using historical data. The backtesting process consists of three parts: 1. determining the universe of securities where we will invest in (e.g. equity or fixed income? US or emerging markets?); 2. gathering historical data for the universe of securities; and 3. implementing a trading strategy using the historical data collected.
